<b>Technologies & Tools</b><br>
During our first meeting, we decided on an initial set of tools that we are comfortable and familiar with using, while ensuring they support our goals. 

The main tool we will use is Laravel which will act as the backbone of our project. Laravel is a PHP web framework designed for large scalable websites. It allows to manage our frontend and backend while also allowing to choose a database of our choice. We will be mainly using HTML, CSS, Javascript for the front end and PHP for backend.

For our database, we will use a MongoDB (NoSQL) which will be useful for handlings a large set of messages in our discord-like app.
